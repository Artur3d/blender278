/**
 * This struct contains all the global data required to run a simulation.
 * At the time of this writing, this structure contains data appropriate
 * to run a simulation as described in Deformation Constraints in a
 * Mass-Spring Model to Describe Rigid Cloth Behavior by Xavier Provot.
 *
 * I've tried to keep similar, if not exact names for the variables as
 * are presented in the paper.  Where I've changed the concept slightly,
 * as in stepsPerFrame compared to the time step in the paper, I've used
 * variables with different names to minimize confusion.
